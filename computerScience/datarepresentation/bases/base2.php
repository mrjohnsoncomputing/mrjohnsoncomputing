        <p>
            Base<sub>2</sub>, otherwise known as Binary, is an incredibly easy way to write numbers, because we only have two numbers to choose from.
            Instead of using all ten numbers from 0 - 9 like in Base<sub>10</sub>, we only use two numbers, 0 and 1 in Base<sub>2</sub>. (Hopefully you can see why Base<sub>10</sub> is called Base<sub>10</sub> and Base<sub>2</sub> is called Base<sub>2</sub> now.)
        </p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>5<sub>10</sub> is equal to 101<sub>2</sub></p>

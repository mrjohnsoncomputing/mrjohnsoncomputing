        <p>
            Base 10 is the number system you are used to. 
            Counting from 0, when we get up to 9, to get to the next number we put a 0 in the units column and 
            a 1 in the tens column to show that we have counted up to 10 once. If we put a 2 in the tens column,
            we would know that we had counted to 10 twice.
            <br>
            Or in other words, we have counted to 1 twenty times.

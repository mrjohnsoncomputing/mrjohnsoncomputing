        <p>Data is a fundamental part of programming, and we need to be clear about how we talk about it.</p>
        <h2>Char</h2>
        <p>
            Char is a single character, number, letter or symbol, as long as it is only one character. 
            Chars are normally used with single quotes 'like this' instead of double quotes, "like this".
        </p>
        <code>var char = 'f'</code>
        <h2>String</h2>
        <p>String is any plaintext sequence of characters of any length.</p>
        <code>var string = "This is a string"</code>
        <h2>Integer</h2>
        <p>An integer is any whole number, positive or negative.</p>
        <code>var integer = 10</code>
        <h2>Floating Point Number</h2>
        <p>
            A Float (Floating Point Number) is any number with a decimal point.
        <br> The reason we call it a float is explained in the <a href="#">binary section</a>
        </p>
        <code>var float = 3.3333</code>
        <h2>Boolean</h2>
        <p>A Boolean value can be one of two values: True or False.</p>
        <code>var bool = True</code>
        <h2>Void</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is necessary to have a value for nothing. For something that doesn not exist, that is undefined. 
        </p>
        <code>var empty = void</code>

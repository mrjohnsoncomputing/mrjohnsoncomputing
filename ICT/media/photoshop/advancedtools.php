                <td>
                    This is a classic photoshop feature - being able to select one part of an image 
                    and draw it in somewhere else lets you do some very powerful things, 
                    such as removing people from photos or improving how things look.

                <td>
                    The magic eraser tool is much like the magic wand tool, but instead of selecting, it erases.
                    It will erase all areas of the image that are the same colour and touching the part you click on with the magic eraser.
                    Try it out to see its power - make sure you change the "Tolerance" number and see what happens!

                <td>
                    A gradient is when one colour blends into another.
                    This tool allows you to paint a gradient across a layer - be it text, a shape, or just a general background.
                    You can use multiple colours, draw it in any direction, and change the style of the gradient.

                <td>Blur Tool</td>
                <td>
                    Sometimes you may want to blur something out in your image, either to hide it, or to shoft the focus to something else.
                    The blur tool is used like the brush or eraser tool, click and drag to use it. 
                    It has a size that you can change, as well as how blurry you want it to make things.

                <td>Smudge Tool</td>
                <td>
                    The smudge tool allows you to blend two colours together. 
                    This is mainly a helpful tool for drawing in photoshop, though it does have some uses in editing images too.
                    You can change the size and the strength of the smudge tool to best fit your needs.

                <td>Sponge Tool (o)</td>
                <td>
                    The sponge tool can suck colour out of an image, or soak colour back into an image.
                    We call the process of taking colour out of an image <em>desaturation</em>, 
                    and the process of adding more colour to an image is called <em>saturation</em>.
                    This is an interesting tool that can bring an image to life, but remember that less is more with this tool!

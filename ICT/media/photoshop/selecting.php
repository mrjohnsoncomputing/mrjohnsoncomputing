                    <td>
                        This tool allows you to draw a selection box around something. 
                        Once selected, you can move the part of the layer you have selected, copy it, delete it, 
                        fill it, draw in it and many other actions.

                    <td>
                        This tool is the same as the rectangular marquee tool, but allows you to draw an oval / circle
                        instead of a rectangle. Everything you can do with the rectangular tool can be done with this.

                    <td>Lasso Tool (l)</td>
                    <td>
                        The lasso is good for quickly and roughly selecting something. 
                        It is not very precise, but is very quick to use.

                    <td>Polygonal Lasso Tool (l)</td>
                    <td>This gives you a bit more control than the standard lasso tool, but is still better for quick selections than precise ones.</td>
                    <td class="tableIconVid"><video width=150px muted=True autoplay=True loop=True src="assets/polygonlasso.mp4"></video></td>

                    <td>Magic Wand Tool (w)</td>
                    <td>
                        The magic wand tool is a very powerful selection tool. 
                        It will select all areas of the image that are the same colour and touching the part you click on with the wand.
                        Try it out to see its power - make sure you change the "Tolerance" number and see what happens!
